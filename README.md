# Google-Data-Analytics-Course-Capstone
Capstone/Case Study Project for Google Data Analytics Course 

-YJK 08/27/22-

The Google Data Analytics Course on coursera had a case study/capstone project to put the skills and knowledge I learned throughout the course to test.

The prompt was to analyze and gain an insight on a Bellabeat (fitness wristband) product by analyzing a given dataset from Fitbit.

This README file is to practice using Github in order to share my thought processes and findings regarding this capstone project.
